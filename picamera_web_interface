I want to create a web app similar to RPi Cam Web Interface that uses picamera by Dave Jones(Waveform80).

I love the MotionPie surveillance system based on buildroot and motion for ease of use, great job again.

I love RPi Cam Web Interface for using the Pi Camera day to day hands on.

I love picamera as it has 'every every' camera feature ready to be used by python.

I have not used picroscopy, although that looks super cool.

I would like to see a Swiss army style web implementation to take full advantage of the RasPi Camera abilities and exploit its GPU strength. It would be cool to be able to trigger a full 1080p video record(or full frame recording) on multiple cameras based on 'movement' that the GPU 'sees' because of course motion vectors.
Basically set up a web home page that could link to different ways to use the Pi Camera,
1. Live View for use in production, science imaging(ex. microscope), teaching(virtual overhead), assisted reading, or anywhere that needs a clean HDMi feed.
2. Security System set up
3. Photography usage day to day
3a. GPIO controls of Web App, shutter button, knobs for image controls
3b. Astronomy photography and 'experimental' photography
3c. Photobooth
4. Wii style IR motion tracking or something more complex with multi-cameras

The Raspberry Pi camera is not a DSLR camera, it can be a lot more though in terms of usage.
Heck I still can't believe I own an infrared camera, who needs to load film inside a camera bag anymore.

Currently I am exploring Kerrigell and Django to allow me to use Python in Web development
